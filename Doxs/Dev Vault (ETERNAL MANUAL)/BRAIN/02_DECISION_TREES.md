## FRONTEND DECISION TREES

---

## Tree: Page Not Loading / White Screen

```text
Page not loading?

Is there an error in browser console?

YES Read the error message

"Cannot read properties of undefined"
GO TO: Undefined Property Tree

"Hydration failed" / "Text content mismatch"
GO TO: Hydration Mismatch Tree

"Maximum update depth exceeded"
GO TO: Infinite Loop Tree

"Module not found"
GO TO: Import Error Tree

Other error
Google exact error message

NO Check Network tab

API calls failing?
GO TO: API Debug Tree

API calls pending forever?
Server not responding
Check if server is running
Check correct URL

No API calls at all?
Page might not be reached
Check URL routing
Check middleware blocking

```text

---

## Tree: Undefined Property Error

```text
"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'X')"

What is undefined?

Data from useState
STATE NOT INITIALIZED
FIX: useState([]) instead of useState()
FIX: useState({}) instead of useState()
FIX: useState(null) + null check

Data from props
PARENT NOT PASSING PROP
FIX: Check parent component
FIX: Add default value
FIX: Add prop validation

Data from API response
API RETURNED DIFFERENT SHAPE
FIX: Check Network tab for actual response
FIX: Handle loading state
FIX: Add optional chaining ?.

Nested property (a.b.c.d)
INTERMEDIATE IS UNDEFINED
FIX: Use optional chaining a?.b?.c?.d
FIX: Check each level separately

```text

---

## Tree: Hydration Mismatch

```text
"Hydration failed" / "Expected server HTML to contain..."

What's different between server and client?

Date/Time values
SERVER TIME CLIENT TIME
FIX: Move to useEffect
FIX: Use suppressHydrationWarning
        CODE:
const [date, setDate] = useState(null);
useEffect(() => {
setDate(new Date().toLocaleString());
}, []);

Using window/localStorage/sessionStorage
DOESN'T EXIST ON SERVER
FIX: Check typeof window !== 'undefined'
FIX: Use useEffect for client-only code
FIX: Dynamic import with { ssr: false }

Random values (Math.random, uuid)
DIFFERENT ON EACH RENDER
FIX: Generate once, store in state
FIX: Generate in useEffect
FIX: Use seed-based random

User agent / browser detection
ONLY AVAILABLE ON CLIENT
FIX: Move to useEffect

Browser extension modifying DOM
NOT YOUR BUG
FIX: Add suppressHydrationWarning to body
FIX: Ignore if app works

```text

---

## Tree: Infinite Render Loop

```text
"Maximum update depth exceeded"

Where is the loop?

useEffect without dependency array
RUNS EVERY RENDER
FIX: Add dependency array []
FIX: Add specific dependencies [x, y]

useEffect with object/array in deps
OBJECT REFERENCE CHANGES EACH RENDER
FIX: Use useMemo to stabilize object
FIX: Use individual primitive deps
        CODE:
const options = useMemo(() => ({ ... }), [deps]);

setState called during render
RENDER SET RENDER SET...
FIX: Move setState to useEffect
FIX: Use derived state instead
FIX: Compute value, don't store it

Function in dependency array
FUNCTION RECREATED EACH RENDER
FIX: Use useCallback for the function
        CODE:
const fn = useCallback(() => { ... }, [deps]);

Parent re-renders child infinitely
CHECK PARENT FOR ABOVE ISSUES

```text

### Follow the branches to find the root cause

---

## DEBUGGING DECISION TREE

> **Follow the path to root cause**

---

## Application Not Responding

```text
START: App not responding
  |
+-> Check if process running?
      |
+-> NO: Check logs for crash reason
| -> OOM? Increase memory, fix leak |
| -> Exception? Fix code |
| -> Killed? Check OOM killer, signals |
      |
+-> YES: Check CPU usage
        |

Unless range query involved

Query: WHERE status = 'active' AND user_id = 123
Index: (user_id, status) -- user_id more selective!

Query: WHERE date > '2024-01-01' AND user_id = 123
Index: (user_id, date) -- equality before range!

## When to Run Tests

```text
START: What changed?
  |
+-> Code change in PR?
| -> Run all tests |
  |
+-> Dependency update?
| -> Run all tests + security scan |
  |
+-> Config change only?
| -> Run integration tests |
  |
+-> Documentation only?
-> Skip tests

```text

---

## Deployment Strategy Decision

```text
START: What kind of deployment?
  |
+-> Can have downtime?
| -> Simple replace |
  |
+-> Zero downtime needed?
      |
+-> Easy rollback critical?
| -> Blue-green |
      |
+-> Gradual rollout wanted?
| -> Canary |
      |
+-> Simpler, less resources?
-> Rolling update

## TITAN DECISION TREES (EXPERT LEVEL)

---

## Tree: PRODUCTION DOWN (SEV-1)

\\\
SITE IS DOWN. PANIC? NO.

1. **Is it the Network or the App?**
- Ping the URL. Timeout? -> **DNS/CDN Issue**. Check Cloudflare/AWS Route53.
- 500 Error? -> **App Issue**. Go to step 2.
- 404 Error? -> **Routing/Deployment Issue**. Did a deploy just finish? Rollback.

1. **Check the Vitals (Dashboard)**
- **CPU**: Is it 100%? -> **Infinite Loop / Crypto Miner**. Restart containers.
- **RAM**: Is it 100%? -> **Memory Leak**. Restart and check 'Memory Leak Hunter'.
- **DB CPU**: Is it 100%? -> **Bad Query**. Go to 'Slow Query Killer'.

1. **Check the Logs (The Truth)**

*Filter by 'level:error'.* Look for 'Connection Refused' (DB down).

- Look for 'EMFILE' (Too many open files/sockets).

1. **The 'Restart' Gambit**

*If you don't know the cause, restart the service.* Does it come back?
*YES: It's a resource leak or transient bug. Buy time to investigate.* NO: It's a configuration or code bug. Rollback to previous version.

\\\

## Tree: THE SLOW QUERY KILLER

\\\
DATABASE IS SLOW.

1. **Identify the Query**

*Enable 'Slow Query Log' (>100ms).* Find the query appearing most often or taking longest.

1. **EXPLAIN ANALYZE**

*Run \EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...\* Look for **'SEQ SCAN'** (Sequential Scan).
*This means it's reading the WHOLE table.* **FIX**: Add an Index on the column in the WHERE clause.

1. **Index Miss?**

*Are you using \LIKE '%term%'\? -> Indexes don't work on leading wildcards. Use Full Text Search.* Are you using \OR\? -> Can kill index usage. Try \UNION ALL\.

- Are you casting types? (\WHERE string_col = 123\) -> Index ignored. Fix types.

1. **The N+1 Problem**

*Are you running 1000 simple queries?* **FIX**: Use \IN (...)\ or JOINs to fetch all at once.

\\\

## Tree: THE MEMORY LEAK HUNTER (NODE.JS)

\\\
RAM KEEPS GROWING UNTIL CRASH.

1. **The Snapshot**

*Run node with \--inspect\.* Open Chrome DevTools -> Memory -> Take Heap Snapshot.

1. **The Comparison**

*Take Snapshot A.* Do the action (e.g., refresh page 10 times).
*Take Snapshot B.* Compare B vs A. What objects increased and didn't go away?

1. **Common Suspects**
- **Global Variables**: Arrays that never get cleared.
- **Event Listeners**: \socket.on('data', ...)\ added but never removed.
- **Closures**: Large objects held in scope by a tiny function.

1. **The Fix**
- Set large objects to \

ull\ when done.

*Always use \.removeListener()\.* Use \WeakMap\ for caching (auto-garbage collected).
