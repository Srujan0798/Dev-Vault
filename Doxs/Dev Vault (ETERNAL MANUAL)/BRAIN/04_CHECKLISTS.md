## DATABASE MIGRATION CHECKLIST

> **Safe migration execution**

---

## Pre-Migration

    [ ] Tested on staging with production-like data
    [ ] Backup taken
    [ ] Rollback script ready
    [ ] Off-peak timing planned
    [ ] Team notified
    [ ] Monitoring ready
    

## During Migration

    [ ] Watch for lock wait timeouts
    [ ] Monitor query performance
    [ ] Check replication lag
    [ ] Watch disk usage
    [ ] Monitor connection count
    

## Safe Migration Patterns

    ADDING COLUMN:
    [ ] Nullable or with default
    [ ] No table lock (most DBs)
    
    RENAMING COLUMN:
    [ ] Add new column
    [ ] Dual-write
    [ ] Migrate reads
    [ ] Remove old column
    
    ADDING INDEX:
    [ ] Use CONCURRENTLY (PostgreSQL)
    [ ] Off-peak hours
    [ ] Monitor table size
    

## Post-Migration

    [ ] Verify data integrity
    [ ] Run smoke tests
    [ ] Check query performance
    [ ] Confirm no errors in logs
    [ ] Update team

## CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST

> **The review patterns that catch bugs**

---

## Functionality

    [ ] Does the code do what its supposed to?
    [ ] Edge cases handled?
    [ ] Error handling in place?
    [ ] Happy path works?
    [ ] Unhappy path works?
    

## Security

    [ ] SQL injection prevented?
    [ ] XSS prevented?
    [ ] Authorization checked?
    [ ] Secrets not exposed?
    [ ] Rate limiting in place?
    

## Performance

    [ ] N+1 queries avoided?
    [ ] Large data paginated?
    [ ] Unnecessary computation avoided?
    [ ] Caching considered?
    [ ] Indexes used properly?
    

## Maintainability

    [ ] Code readable?
    [ ] Functions small and focused?
    [ ] Names descriptive?
    [ ] Complex logic commented?
    [ ] Tests included?
    [ ] Documentation updated?
    

## Common Issues

    [ ] No console.logs left
    [ ] No debug code
    [ ] No TODO without issue link
    [ ] No sensitive data in logs
    [ ] Lock file updated
    [ ] Migration reversible
