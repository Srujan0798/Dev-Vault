# 🧠 BRAIN - The Thinking Engine

> **This folder contains the AI's thinking methodology.**
> Not just knowledge, but HOW to apply that knowledge.
> The difference between having data and having a senior developer's brain.

BRAIN/
├── DECISION_TREES.md    → How to diagnose problems

## 🎯 Purpose

## The Manual serves TWO functions

### 📚 KNOWLEDGE (../Dev Vault files)

```text
WHAT: Implementation patterns
HOW: Code examples
WHEN: Appropriate use cases

```text

### 🧠 BRAIN (this folder)

```text
THINK: Decision trees for diagnosis
CHECK: Checklists for completeness
LINK: Dependency maps for connections
FIND: Root cause database for quick fixes

```text

## 🩺 VACCINE vs 💉 INJECTION

## VACCINE (Preventive)

- Check BEFORE deployment
- Catch issues BEFORE they become bugs
- Pre-commit, pre-deploy checklists
- Cross-cutting concern reminders

## INJECTION (Reactive)

- Debug AFTER errors appear
- Diagnose root cause quickly
- Fix systematically
- Verify thoroughly

### This folder contains BOTH approaches.

## 🔗 How to Use

## Before Coding a Feature

1. Check **CHECKLISTS.md** → What do I need?
2. Check **DEPENDENCY_MAPS.md** → What connects to this?

## When Debugging

1. Check **DECISION_TREES.md** → Follow diagnosis path
2. Check **ROOT_CAUSE_DATABASE.md** → Symptom → Cause → Fix

## Before Deploying

1. Check **CHECKLISTS.md** → Pre-deployment checklist
2. Check **DEPENDENCY_MAPS.md** → Did I update everything?

## After Fixing

1. Check **CHECKLISTS.md** → Post-fix verification
2. Verify all related systems work

---

## 🌟 The Goal

When AI reads this folder, it should:

```text
SEE ERROR → Know exactly what to check
MAKE CHANGE → Know what else to update
FIX BUG → Know how to verify it works
DEPLOY → Know nothing is forgotten

```text

### This is the external brain that makes AI think like a senior developer.
