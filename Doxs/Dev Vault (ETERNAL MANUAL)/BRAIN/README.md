## 🎯 Purpose

## The Manual serves TWO functions

### 📚 KNOWLEDGE (../Dev Vault files)

    WHAT: Implementation patterns
    HOW: Code examples
    WHEN: Appropriate use cases
    

### 🧠 BRAIN (this folder)

    THINK: Decision trees for diagnosis
    CHECK: Checklists for completeness
    LINK: Dependency maps for connections
    FIND: Root cause database for quick fixes

## 🩺 VACCINE vs 💉 INJECTION

## VACCINE (Preventive)

- Check BEFORE deployment
- Catch issues BEFORE they become bugs
- Pre-commit, pre-deploy checklists
- Cross-cutting concern reminders

## INJECTION (Reactive)

- Debug AFTER errors appear
- Diagnose root cause quickly
- Fix systematically
- Verify thoroughly

### This folder contains BOTH approaches

---

## 🔗 How to Use

## Before Coding a Feature

1. Check **CHECKLISTS.md** → What do I need?
1. Check **DEPENDENCY_MAPS.md** → What connects to this?

## When Debugging

1. Check **DECISION_TREES.md** → Follow diagnosis path
1. Check **ROOT_CAUSE_DATABASE.md** → Symptom → Cause → Fix

## Before Deploying

1. Check **CHECKLISTS.md** → Pre-deployment checklist
1. Check **DEPENDENCY_MAPS.md** → Did I update everything?

## After Fixing

1. Check **CHECKLISTS.md** → Post-fix verification
1. Verify all related systems work

---

## 🌟 The Goal

When AI reads this folder, it should:

    SEE ERROR → Know exactly what to check
    MAKE CHANGE → Know what else to update
    FIX BUG → Know how to verify it works
    DEPLOY → Know nothing is forgotten
