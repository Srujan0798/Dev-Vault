## ✅ DATABASE MIGRATION CHECKLIST

> **Safe migration execution**

---

## Pre-Migration

    [ ] Backup taken
    [ ] Rollback script ready
    [ ] Off-peak timing planned
    [ ] Team notified
    [ ] Monitoring ready
    

## During Migration

    [ ] Watch for lock wait timeouts

    [ ] Monitor connection count
    

## Safe Migration Patterns

    RENAMING COLUMN:
    [ ] Add new column
    [ ] Dual-write
    [ ] Migrate reads
    [ ] Remove old column
    
    ADDING INDEX:
    [ ] Use CONCURRENTLY (PostgreSQL)
    [ ] Off-peak hours
    [ ] Monitor table size
    

## Post-Migration

    [ ] Verify data integrity
    [ ] Run smoke tests
    [ ] Check query performance
    [ ] Confirm no errors in logs
    [ ] Update team

## Performance

    [ ] N+1 queries avoided?
    [ ] Large data paginated?
    [ ] Unnecessary computation avoided?
    [ ] Caching considered?
    [ ] Indexes used properly?
    

## Maintainability
